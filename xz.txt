Today, I am feeling soo low I don't know but i feel like I am the loneliest person. I am missing you soo much.
I know you have told me that you are not coming this September but seriously I don't know why but I very strongly feel that you will come tomorrow. I don't know what this feeling is, maybe just my intution but I cannot explain this.
Today, on the call I have heard you saying to someone that, "Jhadu lele apni m kal nikalra hu". I am 99% sure that it was your voice, 1% it may not be yours but that line just one line gave me soo much of joy that i can't express to you. seriously if you are comming and if you will surprize me anyday by coming then you know I don't know how will I react, mayde I will just cry being speechless or just soo mesmerized orr just hug you tightly or maybe just look at you and cry of happiness.
You mean soo much to me yarr. To not seeing you for soo long and this 50-50 feeling that you will come or you will not come this is a whole different thing to experience. I know I irritate you alot but to the fact I love you more than that. I maynot be the perfect girlfriend or the perfect partner that you expected from me but everyday I try to be better, I try to be the best that can make you happy.
You are not just a person to me you are my whole world. I know if you find this or if you read this, you will think how stupid mahak is or you may think yh toh pagal hi h prr seriously "You are truly my Horcrux" - the one inside which my soul exist. I hope I can say all this things to you but if you are coming than this will become your plan faliure and if you are not coming than this will irritate you. 
But all I want to say is ILOVEYOU❤️ and i really mean it.
